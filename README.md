# blizz_token_tracker
A Node.js project to pull Blizzard WoW token data to a database and display a graph of price changes on the front-end.

This project was created to track and store the Blizzard token prices over time and analyze the changes. The project requires the following:
- a mysql database
- an account with mashed to access the Blizzard API
- the access tokens needed to use the API accessed through the developer site -> https://dev.battle.net

Will be adding the stored procedures and tables to the code section in a future update. Live example to come soon.
